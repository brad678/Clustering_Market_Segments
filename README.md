# Clustering_Market_Segments

Description:
- One way to gain an edge in segmented marketing to identify segments of people who share similar tastes, so that they can avoid targeting advertisements to people with no interest in the product being sold. For instance, an alcoholic beverage is likely to be difficult to sell to people who do not drink.
- Given the text of Social Networking Service (SNS) pages of people, we can identify groups that share common interests such as sports, religion, or music. Clustering can automate the process of discovering the natural segments in this population.

Objective:
- Cluster a number of products, with related products in one segment          

This is Unsupervised learning problem. 
The algorithms used are K means, Heirarchical clustering and PAM (partitioning around medoids)

The metric used is average silhouette width
